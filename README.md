# Hi there, I'm Soham Aserkar! üëã
Master's Student in Robotics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA.

- üå± I'm currently using NLP techniques, including BERT and XLNet, to detect policy toxicity in policy documents and applying deep learning concepts to perform policy analysis.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Robotics, Control, Perception, NLP, and Computer Vision.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects related to my interests!
- üì´ You can reach me at ssaserkar@wpi.edu!
